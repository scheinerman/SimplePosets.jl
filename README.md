# SimplePosets

**Breaking change in 0.2.0**: The function `stack` is replaced by `vcat`. 

<hr>

This module defines a `SimplePoset` type for Julia. A *poset* is a
pair `(X,<)` where `X` is a set of elements and `<` is a relation on
`X` that is irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.


## Basic constructor

Use `SimplePoset(T)` to create a new `SimplePoset` with elements
having type `T` (which defaults to `Any`).


## Add/delete elements/relations

Elements and relations can be added to or deleted from a poset using
these functions:

* `add!(P,x)` adds a new element `x` to the ground set of `P`.
* `add!(P,x,y)` inserts the relation `x<y` into `P`. If one (or both)
  of `x` and `y` is not in `P`, it is added as well.
* `delete!(P,x)` deletes element `x` from this poset.
* `delete!(P,x,y)` delete the relation `x<y` from `P` and for any `z`
  with `x < z < y`, also delete `x<z` and `z<y`.

More detail on element/relation addition/deletion can be found in the
document `addition-deletion.pdf` found in the `doc` folder.

## Basic inspection

* `elements(P)` returns a list of the elements in `P`
* `card(P)` returns the cardinality of `P` (number of elements).
* `relations(P)` returns a list of all pairs `(x,y)` with `x<y` in
  this poset.
* `incomparables(P)` returns a list of all incomparable pairs. If
  `(x,y)` is listed, we do not also list `(y,x)`.
* `has(P,x)` determine if `x` is an element of `P`.
* `has(P,x,y)` determine if `x<y` in the poset `P`. **Note**: Calling
  `has(P,x,x)` for an element `x` of this poset returns `false`. All
  our methods concern the strict relation `<`.
* `above(P,x)` returns a list of all elements above `x` in `P`.
* `below(P,x)` returns a list of all elements below `x` in `P`.
* `interval(P,x,y)` returns a list of all elements `z` that satisfy
  `x<z<y`.
* `maximals(P)` returns a list of the maximal elements of `P`.
* `minimals(P)` returns a list of the minimal elements of `P`.
* `components(P)` returns the ground sets of the connected components of `P` as a `Partition`.


The following functions are not likely to be called by the casual user.

* `check(P)` returns `true` provided the internal data structures of
  `P` are valid and `false` otherwise. **Note**: There should be no
  reason to use this function if the poset is created and manipulated
  by the functions provided in this module.
* `hash(P)` computes a hash value for the poset. This enables `SimplePoset`
  objects to serve as keys in dictionaries, and so forth.
* `eltype(P)` returns the datatype of the elements in this poset. For example:

  ```
  julia> P = BooleanLattice(3);

  julia> eltype(P)
  SimplePoset{String} (8 elements)
  ```

## Constructors

* `Antichain(n)` creates an antichain with elements `1:n`. The
  function `IntPoset(n)` is a synonym.
* `Antichain(list)` creates an antichain with elements drawn from
  `list`, a one-dimensional array.
* `BooleanLattice(n)` creates the subsets of an `n`-set poset in which
  elements are named as `n`-long binary strings.
* `Chain(n)` creates a chain with elements `1:n` in which
  `1<2<3<...<n`.
* `Chain(list)` creates a chain with elements drawn from `list` (in that
  order) in.
* `Divisors(n)` creates the poset whose elements are the divisors of
  `n` ordered by divisibility.
* `PartitionLattice(n)` creates the poset whose elements are the partitions of
`{1,2,...,n}` ordered by refinement.
* `RandomPoset(n,d)` creates a random `d`-dimensional poset on `n`
  elements.
* `SimplePoset(G::SimpleGraph)` creates the vertex-edge poset of `G`. 
* `StandardExample(n)` creates the canonical `n`-dimensional poset
  with `2n` elements in two layers. The lower layer elements are named
  from `-1` to `-n` and the upper layer from `1` to `n`. We have
  `-i<j` exactly when `i!=j`.

## Operations

* `inv(P)` creates the inverse poset of `P`, i.e., we have `x<y` in
`P` iff we have `y<x` in `inv(P)`. We can use `P'` as a synonym for
`inv(P)`.
* `intersect(P,Q)` creates the intersection of the two posets (which
must be of the same element type). Typically the two posets have the
same elements, but this is not necessary. The resulting poset's
elements is the intersection of the two element sets, and relations
in the result are those relations common to both `P` and `Q`.
* `induce(P,A)` forms the induced subposet of `P` using the elements
in the set `A`.
* `P*Q` is the Cartesian product of the two posets (that may be of different types).
* `P+Q` (or `hcat(P,Q)`)is the disjoint union of two (or more) posets. The posets must
all be of the same type. Each summand's elements is extended with an
integer (starting at 1) corresponding to its position in the
sum. That is, if `x` is an element of summand number `i`, then in
the sum it becomes the element `(x,i)`. For example:

  ```julia
  julia> P = Chain(2)+Chain(3)+Chain(4)
  SimplePoset{(Int64,Int64)} (9 elements)

  julia> elements(P)
  9-element Array{(Int64,Int64),1}:
   (1,1)
   (1,2)
   (1,3)
   (2,1)
   (2,2)
   (2,3)
   (3,2)
   (3,3)
   (4,3)
  ```

* `vcat(Plist...)` creates a new poset from the ones in the argument
  list by stacking one atop the next. The first poset in the list is
  at the bottom.  Element labeling is as in `+`. Note that `P/Q` is 
  equivalent to `vcat(Q,P)` and `P\Q` is equivalent to `vcat(P,Q)`.
* `relabel(P,labels)` is used to create a new poset in which the elements
   have new names (as given by the dictionary `labels`). Calling
   `relabel(P)` gives a new poset in which the new element names are
   the integers `1` through `n`. Here's an example:

   ```
   julia> P = Chain(3) + Chain(3)
   SimplePoset{(Int64,Int64)} (6 elements)

   julia> elements(P)
   6-element Array{(Int64,Int64),1}:
    (1,1)
    (1,2)
    (2,1)
    (2,2)
    (3,1)
    (3,2)

   julia> Q = relabel(P)
   SimplePoset{Int64} (6 elements)

   julia> elements(Q)
   6-element Array{Int64,1}:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
   ```

## Poset properties

* `ComparabilityGraph(P)` returns a `SimpleGraph` whose vertices are
  the elements of `P` and in which two distinct vertices are adjacent
  iff they are comparable in `P`.
* `CoverDigraph(P)` returns a directed graph whose vertices are the
  elements of `P` in which `(x,y)` is an edges provided both `x<y` in `P`
  and there is no `z` for which `x<z<y`. These are the edges that would
  appear in a Hasse diagram of `P`.
* `mobius(P)` creates the Mobius function for this poset (as a
  dictionary from pairs of elements to `Int` values).
* `mobius_matrix(P)` is the inverse of `zeta_matrix(P)`.
* `zeta(P)` creates the zeta function for this poset (as a dictionary
  from pairs of elements to `Int` values). We have `(x,y) ==> 1`
  provided `x==y` or `x<y`, and `(x,y) ==> 0` otherwise.
* `zeta_matrix(P)` produces the zeta matrix. Order of elements is the
  same as produced by `elements(P)`.
* `height(P)` returns the maximum size of a chain.

## Linear extensions

+ `linear_extension(P)` finds one linear extension of the poset (as an
  `Array`).
+ `random_linear_extension(P)` returns a random linear extension. See the
   help message for more detail.
+ `all_linear_extensions(P)` returns a `Set` containing all the linear
  extensions of the poset. This is a *very* expensive operation in
  both time and memory. It is memoized to make it more efficient, but
  the memory it uses is *not* freed after use.

```
julia> P = Divisors(12)
SimplePoset{Int64} (6 elements)

julia> linear_extension(P)'
1×6 LinearAlgebra.Adjoint{Int64,Array{Int64,1}}:
 1  2  3  4  6  12

julia> random_linear_extension(P)'
1×6 LinearAlgebra.Adjoint{Int64,Array{Int64,1}}:
 1  3  2  6  4  12

julia> collect(all_linear_extensions(P))
5-element Array{Array{Int64,1},1}:
 [1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 12]
 [1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 12]
 [1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 12]
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
 [1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 12]
  ```

## Miscellaneous

### Under the hood ###

A `SimplePoset` is a wrapper around a `DirectedGraph` object. The
functions for creating and manipulating a `SimplePoset` ensure that
the underlying digraph has directed edges `(x,y)` exactly for those
pairs of elements with `x<y`.
